When and why should we use arrays? 
- Arrays are really good at sorting data because they are in sequential order according to their index. 
- Arrays are great for fast lookups, accessing information where you know which index you want to lookup. 
- Really fast at push and pop - adding and taking away from the array. 
- Ordered - having something that is ordered and close to each other in memory makes it fast. 

Weaknesses:
- slow inserts
- slow deletes
- fixed size when using static array
