// DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHIMS 
 Data structures allow us to organize and store data, while algorithms allow us to process that data in a meaningful way. 

// BIG O - How long does an algorithm take to run? 

What is good code? 
1. Readable - can others understand your code?
2. Scalable - When we grow bigger and bigger with our input, how much does the algorithm slow down? The less the better! 

// BIG O NOTATIONS
O(n) - Linear Time; for loops, while loops throuh n items. 
O(1) - Constant Time - excellent, very scalable. Doesn't matter how many elements there are, it always will run the same - no loops. 
O(n^2) - Quadratic- every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two
nested loops. 


// EXAMPLE OF BIG O NOTATIONS 
function anotherFunChallenge(input) {
  let a = 5;  //O(1)
  let b = 10; //O(1)
  let c = 50; //O(1)
  for (let i = 0; i < input; i++) {  
    let x = i + 1;  //O(n)
    let y = i + 2;  //O(n)
    let z = i + 3;  //O(n)

  }
  for (let j = 0; j < input; j++) {
    let p = j * 2;  //O(n)
    let q = j * 2;  //O(n)
  }
  let whoAmI = "I don't know";  //O(1)
}

BIG O is (4 + 5n) // 7n if we include for loops. HOWEVER, WE ALWAYS WANT TO REMOVE CONSTANTS SO THIS JUST BECOMES O(n). 

//COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTION
-Log all parts of array 

const boxes = [1,2,3,4,5];

function logAllPairsOfArray(array){
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < array.length; j ++) { 
      console.log(i, j)
    }
  }
}

RULE OF THUMB: IF YOU SEE NESTED LOOPS WE USE MULTIPLICATION. THEREFORE THE O NOTATION FOR THIS BECOMES O(n^2).
