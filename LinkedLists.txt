A Linked List contains a set of nodes, these nodes have two elements; The value of the data and a pointer to the next node in line. 
The first Node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. 

Why should we use Linked Lists? How are they better than arrays and Hash Tables? 
The main difference between Linked Lists and an array is that in an array elements are indexed. In a Linked List it starts at the head and it traverses 
all the way to the end. Array items are located next to each other in memory, Linked Lists are scattered. Traversing through a Linked List is slower 
than iterating through items in an array (both of these are O(n)). 

The obvious advantage that a Linked List has over a Hash Table is that it has order.

What is a pointer in CS?
A pointer is simply a reference to an object or just a reference.
