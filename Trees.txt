Trees
> Trees are a data structure that have a "hierarch" goal.
> A tree usually starts with a single root node (or parent node) and every child of the tree descends from that node. 
> Trees can have 0 or more child nodes.


Where can we see examples of Trees being used in programming? 
Web pages are created by using DOM (Document Object Model) which is a tree data structure. Within the DOM we have a head and a body that are 
children of the HTML tag and inside the body there are many more children that make them connected hierarchical to one another. 

Binary Trees
> Type of tree where each node can only have either 0, 1 or 2 nodes and each child can only have 1 parent. 
> Each nodes represents a certain state.
