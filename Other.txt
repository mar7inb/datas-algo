*Good software engineers choose the right data structure and algorithim to create a good program. 

// THREE PILLARS OF PROGRAMMING 
1. READABLE - Clean code

2. SPEED - Efficient time complexity

3. MEMORY - Space complexity

// IN MOST PROGRAMMING CODE SOLUTIONS THERE IS USUALLY A TRADE OFF BETWEEN SPEED AND MEMORY.
