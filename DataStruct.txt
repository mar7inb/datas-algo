- A data structure is collection of values. It's a way to organize data and store things such as strings, booleans, numbers, etc.
Arrays and Objects in JSare a data structure that allow us to store info. 

What is an Algorithm?
- Algorithms, are the steps or processes we put into place to manipulate these collections of values. It's what allows us to write programs. 

*A person who knows how Data Structures + Algorithims work and how to use them can write great programs. 

Although it may be important to know the latest and greatest syntax or library of any programming language - 
these things change. 
Knowing the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms is far more important to become a great dev/engineer.

// ARRAYS 
const script = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//4*4 = 16 bytes of storage, if on 32-bit sys. 

script[2] // O(1)
//push - adds an item to the arr
script.push(5); // O(1)

//pop - removes last item in arr
script.pop();
script.pop(); // O(1)

//unshift - add item to beginning of arr
script.unshift(0) // 0(n)

//splice 
script.splice(2, 0, 7) // 0(n)

console.log(script)
