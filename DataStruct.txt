- A data structure is collection of values 

What is an Algorithim?
- Algorithims, are the steps or processes we put into place to manipulate these collections of values. It's what allows us to write programs. 

*A person who knows how Data Structures + Algorithims work and how to use them can write great programs. 

Although it may be important to know the latest and greatest syntax or library of any programming language - 
these things change. 
Knowing the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithims is far more important to become a great dev/engineer.
