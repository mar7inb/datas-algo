A Hash Function is simply a function that generates a value for each input that it gets. 

Let's break this down. If we go to https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/ and we type in 'hello' for the string it will give us a bunch a combination 
of letters and numbers; this is what a hash function does, we give it an input and the function generates a random pattern. 

KEY ASPECTS of Hash Tables:
1. One way - if you give someone the random pattern or value the hash function generates they won't know what the input was(hello). 
It's also impossible to know what the input is based on the pattern or value. 

2. The reason we would want to use this in a data structure is to get really fast data access. 

The problem with hash tables is regardless of its speed we could constantly be adding to the same memory space which slows down the ability to access 
or add information. This is called a collision which causes data loss. 

Further understanding Hash Tables:
A hash function has to be used every time we create, read, update, or delete data.
