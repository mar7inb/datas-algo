Stacks and Queues are linear data structures. Linear Data Structures allow us to traverse (Go through data elements sequentially - 1 by 1)
In which only 1 data element can be reached. 

Stacks and Queues are implentend in similar ways and the main differnce between the two is how items get removed. 

Stacks - You can think of them as plates, where there is a piece of data and then another piece of data that gets stacked on top and so on. 
Stacks are useful when you need to know the last value added. For example, browser history. When going back and forth from one site to another
it uses stacks. In Summary; stacks store the previous state of work in memory in such an order that the last one appears first. 

Stacks usually come with 3 types of methods:  pop(removes the last item), push(add a plate), peek(view top plate).
